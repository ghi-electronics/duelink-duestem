To load any of the demos, you need these steps:
1. Plug in DueSTEM to your PC using the included USB C cable.
2. Go to [https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html](https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html). You will need to use `Edge` or `Chrome` Internet browsers.
3. Click connect button on the top right corner. Then select the USB option.
4. You should have one option only but if more than one then select the `DUELink` device.
5. The connect button you clicked earlier changes to a `DUELink` next to a green connect icon.
6. Click and drag [This DueSTEM Link](https://www.duelink.com/code/driver/microblocks/duestem.ubl) into the middle of the MiroBlocks page.

You can now drag any of the images below into the MicroBlocks IDE to try them.

**Note:** It is easier to have 2 browser windows open simultaneously to drag the library and images. Another option is to save the image/library locally onto your machine then drag them in the browser later!

## What is MicroBlocks?

If you want to learn coding, the easy way, MicroBlocks is a blocks language (like Scratch) that makes it easy for beginners (9 years to adults) to program DUELink boards. A huge benefit of MicroBlocks is that it is live and interactive: users can click commands to see what they do and they can test their scripts as they work.
