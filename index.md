To load a project: **Click** ➡ **Connect** ➡ **Run**!

1. **Click** on one of the project links below to load it into MicroBlocks. We explain what MicroBlocks is later on this page.
2. Click **Connect** on the top right corner. Then select the `USB` option. From the new window, select `DUELink`. 
    2. While not likely to happen, if you do not see a `DUELink` device, then you need to reload the MicroBlocks firmware. This is explained later on this page.
3. Click the **Run** triangle ▶ and enjoy! 🎉Congratulations, you are now a coder!

## What is MicroBlocks?

If you want to learn coding the easy way, MicroBlocks is a block-based language that is easy for beginners (9 years to adults) to program DUELink boards. A huge benefit of MicroBlocks is that it is live and interactive; users can click commands to see what they do and they can test their scripts as they work.

## Reload MicroBlocks Firmware

In the unlikely event that MicroBlocks software is not seeing your device, then you need to follow these steps:

1. There are 2 buttons found on the board, Loader (LDR) and Reset (RST). Locate the buttons.
2. Press and hold the LDR button while pressing and releasing RST button. Note how you need to keep holding the LDR button pressed while pressing and releasing the RST button.
2. Go to [console.duelink.com](https://console.duelink.com/) and click `Firmware` on the top menu.
3. Click `Connect` button. You should see `DFU in FS Mode - Paired`. Select it and click `Connect`.
4. Select `MicroBlocks` from the `Firmware` menu.
5. Click `Load` button. You can optionally click `Erase All` first for a complete fresh start!
5. Click `Close`.

The board is now loaded with MicroBlocks firmware, which is what the MicroBlocks software uses to communicate with the board.
